\section{Introduction}
This package provides an essential feature to \LaTeX~that has been missing for too long. It adds a coffee stain to your documents. A lot of time can be saved by printing stains directly on the page rather than adding it manually. You can choose from four different stain types:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item $270^\circ$ circle stain with two tiny splashes 
  \item $60^\circ$ circle stain 
  \item two splashes with light colours
  \item and a colourful twin splash.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Usage}
To use the package, simply place the \texttt{coffee.sty} file in the directory with all of your 
other \texttt{.tex} files \textit{or} install it properly (consult your distribution's manual). 
Then include the following line in the header of your document:
\begin{verbatim}
\usepackage{coffee}
\end{verbatim}
To place a coffee stain on a page, put one of the following commands in the source code of the relevant page: 
\begin{verbatim}
\cofeAm{alpha}{scale}{angle}{xoff}{yoff}
\cofeBm{alpha}{scale}{angle}{xoff}{yoff}
\cofeCm{alpha}{scale}{angle}{xoff}{yoff}
\cofeDm{alpha}{scale}{angle}{xoff}{yoff}
\end{verbatim}
where alpha is the transparency factor $\in [0,1]$. The scale factor is {\tt scale}, and the standard is {\tt scale}=1. 
The angle is in degrees $\in [0,360]$. 
The position relative to the centre of the page is given by x and y
offsets \texttt{xoff} and \texttt{yoff}.

\medskip
Since version 5, you may also use
\begin{verbatim}
\cofeSplash{}
\end{verbatim}
to place a random splash with random parameters on the current
page. There is now also a package option to put coffee on every page like
\begin{verbatim}
\usepackage[onEveryPage]{coffee}
\end{verbatim}


\section{Copyright}
You can freely distribute this package as I do not believe in imaginary property. All stains are self-made, photographed by myself, processed with gimp and traced with Inkscape.
